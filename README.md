# railway_timetable
This is a basic train schedule app made with Node.js. It's designed to be a sample project for hands-on learning.
Running the app:

# Prerequisites:
You need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 7 or newer installed on your computer. The JDK allows you to compile and run Java programs, which is necessary for building this app.

# Building the app:
To prepare the app for running, you need to build it first. This is like assembling all the parts of the app so it's ready to use. You do this by running a command in the terminal (a command-line interface). Use the following command to build the app:
bash
./gradlew build
Here, ./gradlew is a script that runs Gradle, a build tool, with the build command, which tells Gradle to build the project.

# Starting the app:
After building the app, you need to start it. This will make the app run so you can use it. Run the following command to start the app:
bash
./gradlew npm_start
This command tells Gradle to execute the npm_start script, which starts the Node.js server for the app.

# Accessing the app:
Once the app is running, you can view and interact with it using a web browser. Open your browser and go to:
arduino
http://localhost:8080
"localhost" refers to your own computer, and "8080" is the port number where the app is running. This URL will load the train schedule app, and you can start using it.

# Summary:
Install JDK 7 or later: Necessary for building the app.
Build the app: Run ./gradlew build in the terminal.
Start the app: Run ./gradlew npm_start in the terminal.
Use the app: Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080.
This simple app helps you practice building and running a Node.js application with Gradle, a powerful build tool.
